# Front-end_projects
Small projects to improve front-end development skills

For the Login Form or any other project that used the boxicons, import it to CSS:
Copy-paste the stylesheet link into the head to be able to load their CSS
```
<link href='https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.1.4/css/boxicons.min.css' rel='stylesheet'>
```
With this it will load all boxicons fonts into your webpage! :)
